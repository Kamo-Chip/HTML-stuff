                <h2>Brief Summary of His Life</h2>
                <p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, born on the <strong>26<sup>th</sup> of April 121 AD</strong>, was a Roman emperor from <strong>161 - 180 AD</strong> and a stoic philosopher. He 
                was the last of the rulers of Rome known as the <em>Five Good Emperors.</em> <br> Marcus' father died when he was three, and his mother and grandfather raised him. When they passed 
                Marcus was adopted by the, then Emperor Hadrian.</p>
                <p>His reign was marked by a period of military conflict, of which he was victor in most. A statue of him still stands in Rome, where it was erected in celebration of his military victories.</p>

                <h2>Stoicism</h2>
                <p>Meditations, a personal journal of Marcus, is a series of personal writings by Marcus recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published. 
                The work has no official title, so "Meditations" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection.
                These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.</p>
